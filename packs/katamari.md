# Pack notes

Some background on how I chose these tracks:

- The first game's OST is the most familiar by far, so I intended to use every track from it somewhere. But my chat found the start of "Last Samba" extremely unsettling ("oh no why is your game screaming"), so I took it out.

- "We ❤️ Katamari" was my favorite of the games, and I made sure to use most of its tracks. I originally had "Tsuyogari Damashii" ("Bluff Spirit") as Swamp Palace, and that made me quickly realize I didn't want to spend that much time listening to "Tsuyogari Damashii", so I replaced it with "Jesus Island" from Me & My Katamari which is an absolute bop.

- The fourth game, "Beautiful Katamari", has many tracks that are louder and more intense, so I used it for most of the boss tracks.

- I really wish you could hear more of "Angel's Rain", the rain state track. Maybe play a raindo (a No Logic Standard Start game where you avoid rescuing Zelda) sometime.

- I saved "Katamari on the Swing" for that one perfect moment.
