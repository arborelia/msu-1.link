# Setting up this pack for the first time

Run `msupcm.exe` to create the PCM files you'll need.

msupcm.exe is a copy of msupcm++, by qwertymodo. The source code (which also runs on
Linux) is available at <https://github.com/qwertymodo/msupcmplusplus>.

# Using the pack

The EarthBound "[PK Scramble][]" randomizer comes with built-in MSU-1 support, which
will work with any emulator or SNES flash cart that supports MSU-1. I recommend
[Snes9x] 1.60 or later.

Put your PK Scramble ROM in this folder, next to `eb_katamari.msu` and all the PCM files, and name your ROM `eb_katamari.smc`. When choosing your game settings on the
file select menu, choose "I'm using an MSU" as your music option.

[PK Scramble]: http://pkscramble.com/
[Snes9x]: https://github.com/gocha/snes9x-rr/releases

I assume this will work on other EarthBound ROMs using an MSU patch, but I've never
tried it.

# Track list

I don't replace all the music tracks, as some of them are sound effects
or similar things that can't be effectively replaced with Katamari music.
The un-replaced tracks are omitted from the list below.

The number in brackets indicates which game the track is from:

    [1] Katamari Damacy (塊魂)
    [2] We ❤️ Katamari (みんな大好き塊魂)
    [3] Me & My Katamari (僕の私の塊魂)
    [4] Beautiful Katamari (ビューティフル塊魂)
    [5] Katamari Forever (塊魂TRIBUTE)

```
