# Purchasing the soundtrack

This pack does not include the Chicory soundtrack, and you have to supply the soundtrack for it to work.

You can [purchase the soundtrack on Bandcamp](https://radicaldreamland.bandcamp.com/album/chicory-a-colorful-tale-original-soundtrack), or the Steam version will also work.

# Setting up this pack for the first time

This pack contains Qwertymodo's [MSUPCM++][msupcm] tool, a JSON configuration file for it, and a batch file that runs the setup on Windows.

[msupcm]: https://github.com/qwertymodo/msupcmplusplus

To set up this pack:

- [Download](http://arborelia.net/downloads/chicory-msu-v1.2.zip) and unzip this pack
- Copy the MP3s from your Chicory soundtrack into the `Chicory MSU\soundtrack` folder
- Run `_Pack Builder.bat`

The Pack Builder will check whether you have the Steam or Bandcamp soundtrack, and choose the configuration file with the appropriate filenames.

If there are no errors, your pack is ready.
