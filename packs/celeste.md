(get it? It's "transcendent" because you're trans and you're ascending things)

(and also because it's truly amazing music)

# Soundtracks to buy

Celeste has four soundtrack albums. You need to own all of them to use this pack! This pack only contains the configuration that converts your .mp3 soundtracks into .pcm files to use in the game.

Here are Bandcamp links to the soundtracks you'll need. For this pack, you should download them in MP3 format.

# Previous version

This pack is partially based on [a previous pack by cheamo](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12IdbDwNMj_MCgMhYi29EOat9V4jO01P4), which used just the first Celeste OST and could be patched to use the B-sides. 16 of the track timings come directly from cheamo's pack.
